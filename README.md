This extension works when you are visiting the shop page of www.dianping.com, whose url is like www.dianping.com/shop/*. And this extension displays the street view in the shop page, which is much more awesome than the original fashion of displaying the map. In addition, you can visit dianping.com anytime when you find a nice keyword in any page of any website, such as the address of the shop, or the name of the shop, just by selecting the keyword and finding the item in context menu. Two choices you can make at that time, one is adding the shop to your local favourite shops, and the other is searching this keyword in dianping.com. To click the extension icon, you will find your favourites stored locally.
